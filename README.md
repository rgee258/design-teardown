This repository contains a design teardown of the [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) homepage. Homepages change though, so this format of the homepage is dated at mid June of 2019.

The page presented is an exercise on visual hierarchy and is marked in gray sections, which become darker based on which sections draw the eyes more. Highlighted are the sections that pop out more than others on the actual website.
